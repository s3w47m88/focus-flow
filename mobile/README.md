# Mobile Directory

This directory contains all mobile-specific code and configuration for the iOS version of Loud & Clear.

## Important Notes

- This directory is completely isolated from the web application
- Changes here do not affect the web app
- iOS project files are generated by Capacitor
- Do not commit the `ios/` directory to git (it's generated)

## Build Process

1. The web app is built with mobile configuration
2. Static files are copied to mobile directory
3. Capacitor syncs files to iOS project
4. Native iOS build is created

## Environment

Mobile builds use `.env.mobile` for configuration, which sets:
- `USE_SUPABASE=true`
- `REQUIRE_AUTH=true`
- `IS_MOBILE=true`
