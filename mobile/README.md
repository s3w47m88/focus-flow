# Mobile Directory

This directory contains all mobile-specific code and configuration for the iOS version of Command Center.

## Structure

```

```

## Important Notes

- This directory is completely isolated from the web application
- Changes here do not affect the web app
- iOS project files are generated by Capacitor
- Do not commit the `ios/` directory to git (it's generated)

## Build Process

1. The web app is built with mobile configuration
2. Static files are copied to mobile directory
3. Capacitor syncs files to iOS project
4. Native iOS build is created

## Environment

Mobile builds use `.env.mobile` for configuration, which sets:
- `USE_SUPABASE=true`
- `REQUIRE_AUTH=true`
- `IS_MOBILE=true`

## Capacitor Server Switching

Use these env vars to control where the app loads from:
- `CAPACITOR_SERVER=local|staging|production`
- `CAPACITOR_LOCAL_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:3244`)
- `CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL` (overrides `CAPACITOR_SERVER`)

Common commands:
```
npm run mobile:dev
npm run mobile:staging
npm run mobile:prod

npm run electron:dev
npm run electron:staging
npm run electron:prod
```
