Replace my thoughts with Your thoughts (memorize Scripture). They are firm, they lift me up when I am drowning and set me on high places to have a view I do not otherwise have. They are proven true with time. And they strip foolishness of their fancy robes to reveal them for what they truly are (gossipers and liars). They make me outgoing to share this good news with others and see them lifted up as well. They evoke my focus and I plow through the objections without having to give them my time.

*4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails..."". - 1 Cor. 13

task,Negative Feelings,"The belief that divorce and separation is where I experience the most growth is a lie and an ever-present threat. 

I worry that the world will see my family as a narrative that divorce is inevitable, not so bad, etc... Even under the stars in your sky, dwarfing my problems and showing me they can be reconciled and redeemed.

I feel worthless or unimportant to her. Her belief that she can value me and simultaneously divorce me is sickening. It wounds me endlessly. Please cast out that spirit in her and give her Yours because I know You value me. Show me how to pray for her.

I feel saddened that she tells herself ""You can do this!"" and quotes Your Words like ""God is within her, she shall not fail."" as a fuel for staying on a path of divorce. It makes me sick to my stomach.

I feel sick that she will pass these beliefs onto our children.

I feel threatened by her stubbornness to disobey Your Words about divorce (Mal. 2:16 Matt. 19:6), Malachi says it's a garment of violence. I want to believe You are protecting us but I feel that as far in as we are is proof You cannot protect me and my children, or that You refuse to. I believe the narrative that You may be allowing it is contradictory to Your character and a lie that confuses me about who You are. Which brings me back to Your love, the way You live, is the real power You give me, and I see how powerful it is, but I also feel like I want to withdraw and not bother doing anything for anyone if they will be so violent to me. What is the point?

I want none of these things in my life God.

I just want maturity from her. Maturity to stop being a victim. Maturity to stop the spiritual, emotional, financial and circumstantial violence against me and our children.

It’s just maintaining a pattern of obedience that shows the way.

Jesus, rescue and save my family and I. Reconcile our marriage and redeem it. I know what I believe this looks like, because of these Scriptures and my own desires. But I have doubt because of what Joshua 1 teaches about the consequences of disobeying You. But then John 7 you say that You do not condemn us, and John x says that You give us new life. I know it would take some kind of miracle, and the fuel would be Your love, in both of us. I believe You can do this, but Your will seems to be thwarted by ours. And yet you override it with consequences at times like Moses and Pharaoh. Buy I don’t understand what to hope about. For fear my hope would be misplaced and be toxic optimism. But not hoping seems fruitless and a guarantee of even more pain and suffering.

Help me to walk in faith today, tomorrow. Living as though You won't fail to honor your Promises, but being fully aware that obedience to You IS walking IN the pathway to Your Promises.

note,"On 4/9/25 she told me about Emmas Lupus and Hepatitus B. I said I needed to walk out of the house for some fresh air right after she told me. I thought I might burst into tears. When I came back in she told me that was a moment she felt I had just left her alone. Then she shared a whole lot of other information with me and made some accusatory comments to me along the way.

It really hurt me, and angered me, that even in a moment where I was just told my child has an even more life threatening, life long condition, that she had to blame me for the act of walking outside. And yet she said she understood and wasn't mad. But clearly she was.

Then I tried to respond to things and she just couldn't let me finish anything.

It was becoming clear to me that she was struggling to regulate her emotions, and I was completely unprepared for that entire moment so I felt I didn't even have time to process what I was feeling about Emma's condition, much less how it impacts her future and our family immediately. On top of that feeling attacked was way too much to bring into that.

So, I stayed under control, but said a couple of things to her that triggered her like ""I am a grown man, you don't need to tell me xyz."" But that is obviously an extremely minor thing in the situation, I know this. But, unfortunately, things that are triggering are triggering.

The next day, I got my heart aligned with God through Jesus and came over and talked to her. She was in a really positive mood and that was a real delight. We hit a rough spot in the conversation where she said something like ""You're blaming me.""

In reality I was simply confronting her, to admonish her, to diffuse and prevent future conflict. But this is maybe the key co-dependancy we have. Where she says something to me that hurts me or burdens me without my permission. I try to discuss that, but she accuses me of not staying on topic. I feel further accused and condemned to not being allowed to speak. So then I surrender and leave until a later time, usually the next day, where I can talk to her. But then when we start, at some point, she will become triggered again and I have to navigate it by verbally ""petting"" her to calm her down. So then I have the breakthroughs. But she virtually never apologizes.

So, on this day she said something like ""Afterward I saw that I brought things into the conversation I shouldn't have. I was emotionally compromised and I see I shouldn't have done that."" after I said ""I feel like you asked me to come into the room, I had nothing to discuss and was mentally and emotionally prepared to leave. But you asked to talk. So then when we talked to brought up something that was on top of what you wanted to focus on. Then when I tried to discuss those things I was accused of going off topic and shut down. That's not ok.""

Just writing this out I feel a little fundamentally clearer on how to interact with her when this comes up again.

I think now I need to find some Scripture to hold on to, and then do a video on Instagram/YouTube/Facebook.

I feel that posting those videos is a way of contributing to help other peoples relationships, including my kids' future relationships, from the poison that I see on the internet, that sometimes Brittany has referred me to.

It feels somewhat vindicating, and that I am directing my anger at something I want to actually leave then at Brittany, whom I want to stay. For her sake, our children's and my own.

task,When you accuse you condemn someone to the past so they can't become someone better for the future.,"I know it can hurt to see that I become someone better after you have given up, but I don't need you to believe in me for me to become who you want or need me to be. I don't need you to commit to me for me to be committed to you. You don't owe me, per say, because I choose invest in you. I see any investment in you as producing an ROI to the world, whether I get to directly feel that or not. That is the bottom line: I believe in you and I love who you have become and who you are going to become even with your mistakes or imperfections. I think you deserve that kind of investment. And your success also translates to my children's success. Like you, I have built some of my commitments to our family upon your commitments. So when you haven't honored your commitments to me some of my commitments collapsed. Now, we're both trying to rebuild the commitments we made to ourselves for the future we wanted before we even met each other, much less after, and we want to build that in a way that each other CAN'T make it collapse. And maybe we're not doing that the best way, the smartest way, or the ""right"" way but I believe we are both going to do that. And maybe, hopefully, when we're both there we're going to be able to fly into a love so high that nothing can reach it anymore.

I think you have become a woman who has the highest of standards. For your marriage, for your children, for your business, for me, for Owen, for yourself. For Emmas health. For your self-confidence and self-respect. And while that is very demanding on all of those things it is nothing short of what we all want. And most importantly you are pushing yourself to bring the resources to make those things reality. And that is one of the honest-to-God things that make me say ""Wow. Just. Wow. She is really something special."" And there are actually a lot of people who think that exact thing about you.

One of the only areas I want you to have a higher standard for yourself in is cross examining your beliefs and words so they are inverting accusations back to empathy and leading your comments to me with thanksgiving of what I do and praise of who I am. Because when you tell me something like ""You weren't consistently like this when we were together."" it's truly a condemnation that I don't get to show up how *I* want to. To meet MY standards.

You need to get it out of your head that you ""let"" him go with me. He is OUR son and I have EQUAL authority to take him ANY time I want. It's because I am a good man, who understands how awful it feels to have a spouse who things they can dictate that that I DO NOT say that to you. STOP saying that to me.

And this cause sa WHOLE new type and level and set of strife in our family that ABSOLUTELY prevents healing of almost any kind, certainly whole healing. YOU need to take responsibility for YOUR part and BE CONSISTENT.

Owen needs you and I to go to therapy to parent him properly. Then WE need to go together with him. We DO have a schedule. YOU need to remember it and honor it. We DID discuss Owen spending a day or half day with me, even staying the night. The workout time was added to the calendar. But we didn't add anything about me having him all day because we talked about how you were basically not monitoring him so it wasn't a big deal he goes with me.

This is going to be ""Brittany expresses her fears and concerns and Spencer partners with her to resolve them."" This stupid fortress the enemy has established CAN be taken down. But YOU have to stop saying ""I can't."" ""God can't."" ""It won't."" And all the negative accusations that the enemy wants you to believe. Because I CANNOT do this by myself.

A year later the mission will be complete and you'll be debt free. Then he'll but you land and start on the road to build your very own home. One day you'll have a nightmare that he dies, and you'll be unable to shake it. you'll go to him crying and asking him not to die. When you take down the love quotes of the walk he will turn them into paper roses that you decide to keep in a vase under your tv instead of throwing out or putting away. In his most broken moments instead of turning to women, drugs, alcohol, danger, he'll turn to Jesus. On the nights he feels the most betrayed, abandoned, alone and longing for affection and companionship instead of running to the arms of another he will on these to remind himself of how long more to be there things with you than anything without you. When you turn to others who encourage you to leave him over and over he will conquer the hatred of them by using the hope of Jesus that together you and him can find a way to restore those friendships. Eventually you'll come to a place where the pain he's caused you, and the pain of your broken childhood and examples o from your parents room do anything to make convince him to quit on you. But it will be too late because he will have learned how to value your investments in him that there will be nothing you can seem to do that causes him to abandon you. And one day, he will stop taking from you, and just give. Give give give. Until there's nothing left of him to give. And in this moment of time you'll see value, his price, the cost to be with him and he will say ""To have all of me it will cost all of you. I am a jealous lover as much as a fierce projector and relentless provider. We will have no other person before one another. We will make no idols."" Well, I guess it is time I get back to the present. When you meet him at that coffee shop today I just wish it was me - because I know your value and would cross space and time to tell you if I could. I don't want you to choose me for our kids, although you should. I don't want you to choose me for my house. Although you should. I don't want you to choose me for my money, although you should because it enables you to fulfill your vision for our life. I don't want you to choose me because I will buy you the sprinter van like I bought your dream minivan. I want you to choose me. I want the woman who cried to me about her dream where I died and said ""Please don't die."" to choose me. I want the girl from the coffee shop who saw me and though ""Ohhhhhhhhhhhgh damn."" to choose me. I want the beautiful and blushing women who took me out to the pool tables and paid for it all only to lead me into the forest for a good time to choose me. Just me. For me and you. All of me. Because you like me and love the parts you don't. Because as much as I love our children, and would die for them, I am not choosing you for them. I am choosing you because I REALLY like you. Almost all of you. And the few parts I don't like I love. I really really love.

- I have to be enough. I wish I had nothing so you would just choose me. Like I chose Jesus.
- Choosing to sign our house title says (scriptures) I choose to trust God to heal our brokenness completely, I choose yes when Jesus asks me ""Do you want to be healed?"", what signing this doesn't mean is ""I am ready to be romantic."", ""I am fully healed."", ""I am the woman I need and want to be."",  ""I am not scared.""
- Moving back in together when the house it built. Do not worry about tomorrow for it will take care of themselves and todays troubles are sufficient for today.
- Whatever choices you make when the house is finished it will be appraised immediately. I have gotten some estimate on value, taxes and profit and I believe we will qualify for somewhere between $650,000 and $1,200,000 depending on how much the house sells for. The low end of that is enough for a brand new house at Alpenglow, and the high end is enough for acreage similar or greater than what we have. So I will list it for sale either immediately or in the spring. My vision is for you to spend the  winter shopping for a house in Bend with the kids, running through them until you fall in love with one and come beg me to by it with a ""Pretty please."" so I can pretend to think about it and then crumble and say yes.",4,1,Spencer (47554087),,,,America/Los_Angeles,,,,

task,Brittany's next visit,"I’ve come to understand that you become emotionally flooded, even when it’s positive emotion.

As I considered this, and how I desire to be a source of stillness and calmness - like laying in our bed at 7:30 without saying anything - it absorbs your anxieties.

And having some of our pictures up, as well as some reminders for myself on our mirror, may flood you. So I have take down some photos and replaced them with Scripture and art, and also erased thoughts from the mirror in exchange for beautiful plants.

task,Sabatogue,"I think you need to get real with yourself about how much you have sabatogued our marriage in the last 3-6 years.

- I told you that we needed to consolidate to 1 church and you resisted and fought me. Yet, as soon as you left you said you were reducing Calvary down to 1 time a month.

It's like in the movies when someone says ""I have an idea, what about..."" And the other person says ""No, that won't work. But what about..."" and then they say they exact same thing.

I see in all this a pattern of sabotage. It feels like you have wanted a justification for this for 6 years and that has blinded you to two things: 1. Things have changed, for the better, a lot better, but you aren't accepting it and therefore project a temporary past onto the present. 2. You aren't truly aware of this and if you were you would stop and we could be better teammates and have a lot more of what we truly desire for our marriage, family, each other and ourselves.

Until you are ready to say ""I trust Spencer more than anyone. Because he always protects and supports me. Because I am his priority. Because he strives to be good to me and for me. And when he isn't these things he finds a way. And when there is no way he makes a way. And when he can't make a way he trusts God to through Jesus. I choose him over my best friends like Mandy and Brittany. I choose us over my therapists. I choose our marriage and our family over everything."" then you are on a path in which you have to live with the limitations their ""support"" will provide you, the consequences of",4,1,Spencer (47554087),,,,America/Los_Angeles,,,,
