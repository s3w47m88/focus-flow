task,Address the smoke smell in the Seqouia. @Seqouia,,4,1,Spencer (47554087),,,,America/Los_Angeles,,,,
note,I replaced the air filters and ran the car. But it died at some point so the smell remained. This morning I am doing it again.,,,,Spencer (47554087),,2024-01-04T17:59:35.774000Z,,,,,,
note,"It seems to smell a lot better today, finally. I've been leaving the windows open. But we still need a heavy vacuum of the ceiling, and some sort of cleaning of the ventilation. Maybe spraying the can I have in the glove compartment or center console into the engine air filter and the cabin air filters will help it blow through.",,,,Spencer (47554087),,2024-01-10T19:39:44.892000Z,,,,,,
