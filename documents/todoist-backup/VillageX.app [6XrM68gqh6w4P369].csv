Vision

I imagine creating a Google Workspace account for [no-reply@villagex.app](mailto:no-reply@villagex.app) so we can create an account with Zoho Campaigns. Then configure DKIM and other DNS. Then we can integrate the API between the two to communicate and auto send emails based on certain things.

Technical Notes:

- The application currently uses [PostmarkApp.com](https://PostmarkApp.com) as our mail relay.
    - A mail relay is required because emails sent directly from the server will be commonly blocked by firewalls or sent to spam.
    - We **cannot** send sales and marketing emails through Postmark or our account will quickly get suspended and most likely banned. They are very strict about this.
- We must use a formal email marketing company such as Zoho Campaigns for our email marketing. We may be able to build our own server but it's unlikely to be efficient because it will not have an established sending reputation with major email clients.
    - I have an existing account with Zoho Campaigns for The Portland Company, but not one for Village X yet.",1,1,Spencer (47554087),,,,America/Los_Angeles,,,,
